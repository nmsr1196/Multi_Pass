# Multi_Pass
This will be a livable document until completion of information is done
I will also supply the links

BELOW ARE THE NOTES FOR HOW EVERYTHING WAS USED AND METHODS TO CREATE THE MULTIPASS:

WIRING:
To try and keep a thin profile, I used wire-wrap. To insure connectivity, I also soldered the connections of the wire-wrap connections.

GLUE USED:
I used hot glue to secure the parts. And just a small bead on the bottom of the QT Py. The 3D geometry should hold the QT Py but the bead of glue helps more.

3D Printing Modification:
As mentioned before, this is a re-mix of the Ruiz brothers. The files will be included
-The height geometery of the top part was increased to hold button, QT Py, Oled and neopixel 
-Additional geometry was added for button(if same button is not used,then hot glue is your friend)
-An addition part was created to hold the round acrylic lens. 
-I added some small holes for the wiring to go through so that very little wiring is exposed on top
-Added a battery holder, This depends on the type of LiPo used

ACRYLIC:
There were two simple pieces of clear green 1/8" acrylic used. These were simple and fast to cut. The files will be included
-For the round acrylic lens for the neopixel I used 1/4 clear green acrylic. I used a frosting spray to offset some brightnes of the neopixel light
-For the stem I used a smaller size due to the added geometry of the switch

POWER:
You can used any lipo battery you like. But, you will have to change the 3D holder for it if you don't use the same one I used
-100 mAh LiPo
-Power Boost (You can use any one)

LED:
You can use any led you like. The hole fits a 3mm. If you change to a larger one, the 3D hole will have to be modified
-I used a 3mm green led

BELOW ARE THE PARTS USED:

-QT Py 2040 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4900) I think you can use any version of th QT Py
-7 Neopixel jewel (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2859) I think you can use any one of them. I think they are the same size
-Button (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3870)
-3mm LED (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4202) You can use any type of 3mm LED
-Resistor I used a 2.2K ohm. You can select your own value. I chose a higher value to reduce brightness
-Wire wrap (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CK9GZV6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) I used multiple colors to keep my wiring sanity.
    You can use a solid color option is you like (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1446)    
-OLED SSD1306 I2C (https://www.amazon.com/Pieces-Display-Module-SSD1306-Screen/dp/B08N6N8L5Q/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=oled+i2c&qid=1622717100&sr=8-8)
  You can use any version of this type. I chose this because of it low profile and its wiring connectors on one end.
-3D Material  I had some Prusa Silver PLA, you can use any color/material of your selection
-Acrylic 1/8" green clear acrylic (you can use any color of your choosing) 1/8" fits the created model.
-SP PH 2-pin Cable (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3814) This is for the connection to the power boost. Not needed depends on which powerboost chosen
-PowerBoost (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2030)

BELOW IS THE TYPE OF CARD YOU WILL USE TO PLACE IN YOUR MULTIPASS
You can put in your vaccine card or a card similar to the movie
If you want to use something similiar to the movie I will include a Photoshop file.
-you will/can change the following
-name
-pictures
-other details
-For the xray looking picture. Copy your original picutre and use Photoshop just 'invert'the image under the 'Image', 'Adjustments', then 'Invert' menu.
